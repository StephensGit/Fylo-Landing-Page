## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 
There is a folder called "design" containing the images I used to replicate the landing page.

### N.B

Please note, I didn't use mobile first approach with this project. I've only replicated the desktop verison. There is media queries for mobile and tablet, but you'll notice I haven't replicated to the the mobile design provided in the ' design ' folder.
